# Bachelor-Thesis: Investigation of transformer architectures for geometrical graph structures and their application to two dimensional spin systems

The work for my Bachelors-Thesis is split into multiple repositories (links for quick access, it may be possible that the repo is private).

-   [Main Latex Document and Markdown Notes](https://github.com/jonas-kell/bachelor-thesis-documents)
-   [Experimental Code, Tests and Library-Setup](https://github.com/jonas-kell/bachelor-thesis-experiments)
-   [Final Code/Scripts/Results](https://github.com/jonas-kell/bachelor-thesis-code)

# Explanation

This repository is a collection of the finalized code referenced in the thesis.

The quick start will be added in the future.
